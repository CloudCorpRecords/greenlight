# Changelog

## 0.2.1 (2026-10-14)

Three fixes from dogfooding the tool on real repos.

- **claim_first is now its own soft gate.** `src/gates.ts` used to file
  "comment before starting work" under `assignment_required`, which made
  every shadcn-labs/pdfcn issue read GATED even though commenting first is
  a ritual you satisfy by posting a comment (exactly what the sibling tool
  gatefile calls `claim_first`). The two comment/claim patterns moved to a
  new `claim_first` gate; `assignment_required` keeps only true assignment
  patterns ("ask to be assigned", "must be assigned", assignment before
  submitting). `claim_first` never produces a GATED verdict: like
  `dco_required` and `discussion_first` it is soft, capping an
  otherwise-GO verdict at RISKY with the note "repo asks contributors to
  comment before starting (claim first)". Friction weight -5 (less than
  assignment's -25). The `claim` command's default comment already
  satisfies the ritual, and a test pins that claim-first repos do not get
  the assignment-request variant.
- **Removed `/\bprs welcome\b/i` from the gate parser.** A "prs welcome"
  label is an alternative acceptance signal (seen on FastMCP), not a gate;
  it no longer feeds any gate kind.
- **`scan` falls back to recent open unassigned issues.** `greenlight scan`
  used to report "no starter issues found" for active repos like
  openclaw/openclaw and batrapulkit/squidbrake whose landable issues do
  not carry good-first-issue / help-wanted labels. When the label pass
  comes back empty, scan now lists the repo's recent open unassigned
  issues (pull requests and assigned issues excluded, capped at 25) and
  runs the same verdict checks on the newest 10, with a clear header note
  that these come from the fallback pass. Opt out with `--no-fallback`.
  The MCP `scan_repo` tool uses the same fallback.
- **`prep` learns the repo's branch convention.** Instead of blindly
  naming branches `feat/<slug>-<number>`, prep now reads the head branch
  names of the repo's 30 most recent closed PRs. When at least 3 share a
  dominant suffix token (like `-block` on shadcn-labs/pdfcn) or a common
  prefix style, the suggested branch follows it
  (`feat/quarterly-report-block`) while PREP.md still shows the default
  (`feat/quarterly-report-65`). No pattern, no change.
- The squidbrake friction-index hand entry was reclassified from
  `assignment_required` to `claim_first` to match the new gate kinds.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-14)

Contribution automation. Greenlight now runs the pipeline its author ran by
hand for four real PRs (shadcn-labs/pdfcn #92-#95): verdict, claim comment,
fork branch, PR opening, with DCO awareness throughout.

- New `claim` command (MCP: `claim_issue`): runs the verdict pipeline first,
  refuses TAKEN or STALE issues unless `--force`, shapes the claim comment
  from the repo's gates (assignment-gated repos get an assignment request,
  vouch-gated repos are refused outright since a vouch cannot be automated).
- New `prep` command (MCP: `prep_issue`): checks (and with `--yes` creates)
  your fork and a branch named from the issue title (`feat/<slug>-<number>`),
  then writes a local PREP.md checklist with the verdict, gates, DCO
  reminders, and the exact next commands. Never clones.
- New `pr` command (MCP: `open_pr`): verifies the branch exists on the fork
  and is ahead of upstream, verifies every ahead commit carries a
  Signed-off-by line on DCO repos (refuses and lists the unsigned commits),
  then composes the PR title and body ("Closes #N" plus verdict and gates).
- Safety defaults: read ops stay tokenless; every write command is a DRY
  RUN until `--yes` (CLI) or `execute: true` (MCP); write commands require
  GITHUB_TOKEN (or GH_TOKEN).
- REST client gained a POST helper and an ApiNotFoundError for 404s; issue
  snapshots now carry the issue body for prep checklists.

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-13)

Fixed the linked-PR false positive reported as issue #1. `check` and `scan` no
longer mark an issue TAKEN just because an open PR mentions its number in
passing: shadcn-labs/pdfcn PR #91 closes #70 but lists sibling issues #60-#65
in its body, and that wrongly marked #61 and #71 as taken in v0.1.0.

- Every discovered PR is now fetched and scored with a new link-strength
  classifier (`src/linkstrength.ts`). A PR is "closing" only when its title or
  body uses closing keywords for the issue ("Closes #61"), the issue number
  appears in the PR title, or the issue number is a standalone token in the
  branch name ("feat/61-resume"). Everything else is a "mention".
- Timeline and text search remain discovery only; evidence comes from the PR
  itself. A PR that cannot be fetched defaults to "mention", never "closing".
- Verdict Rule 3 fires TAKEN only for an open "closing" PR. An open PR that
  merely mentions the issue adds a `weak-pr-mention` flag and downgrades an
  otherwise-GO verdict to RISKY ("verify it is not already being worked").
- Stale-claim Rule 6 now treats a "closing" PR, open or not, as "a PR was
  opened". Mentions never count as a linked PR there.

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-13)

First release. Availability verdicts (GO / RISKY / TAKEN / GATED / STALE) for
GitHub issues, repo friction scores, and scan mode ranking a repo's
good-first-issues. Ships as a CLI and an MCP server (check_issue, scan_repo,
repo_friction).
